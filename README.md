# AI Agent Lab — My Learning Journey 🧠🤖

Welcome to my AI Agent Lab!

This is a hands-on, structured learning project based on Liam Ottley's ["How to Build & Sell AI Agents"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[insert_video_link]) course. I'm documenting every step of the process — from building agents with Relevance AI and Voiceflow, to customizing tools, writing prompt schemas, and understanding how these systems work under the hood.

## 🔍 Purpose
- Learn how to build both conversational and automated AI agents
- Customize and improve default templates with tools, prompts, and schemas
- Build a portfolio of working agents and tools
- Reflect critically on the tradeoffs, strengths, and weaknesses of these systems

## 🧱 Agent Builds (Modules)
| Agent | Platform        | Description                                |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Relevance AI     | Sales co-pilot with custom web scraper     |
| 2     | N8N              | Automated lead qualification & notifier    |
| 3     | Voiceflow        | Phone + website chatbot for support & sales|
| 4     | Agent (SaaS)     | WhatsApp-integrated lead gen assistant     |
